# piazzaLinks

**NOTE: This project is deprecated and is no longer maintained.**

A Chrome Extension that helps make navigating to Piazza posts a little easier. It does this primarily by looking for references to Piazza Posts (e.g. @6), and redirects those references to the appropriate Piazza URL. See the [Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/piazza-links/achbgjpjibegjbdeffnggeeoehlhfkck) for a more detailed description.

The files distributed as part of the chrome extension are located in the [`/dist`](/dist) folder. The source JS files are located in [`/src`](/src).
